#### Problem Statement

Veggie-Pizza is a pizza delivery outlet that became popular for its custom-made vegetarian pizzas. ​

A customer can order pizzas and other items over the phone. The outlet delivers the orders at the address specified by the customer.​

To ensure a quality delivery system, one of the key tasks for the Veggie-Pizza outlet owners is to analyze the performance of its delivery people.​

The delivery person is rated by the customers and the outlet owner. The overall rating is the average of ratings provided by customers and the outlet owner.​

The delivery details with average rating should be stored so that it can help in making decisions related to:​

- Identifying star performers on the team​
- Awarding star performers with incentives​
- Conducting training programs for underperformers​

Write JavaScript functions to analyze delivery ​details and maintain the records of average ​ratings obtained by each delivery person.

#### Tasks

- The JSON format makes it easy to transport the data to any external web-server system hence, create JSON data with the details given in the above table.​

    **Note:**

    - A customer can have multiple phone numbers, so they should be stored as array.
    - A customer's address is a complex data consisting of multiple details and thus should be stored as object.

- Convert JSON to JavaScript Object​.
- Define:
    - function `countDeliveries()` to calculate number of orders delivered by a particular delivery person in a particular city.​
        - Sample input to `countDeliveries()`:
            - Delivery Person: Charles Garcia
            - City: Orlando
        - Expected return from `countDeliveries()`:
            2
    - function `calculateTotalTipAmount()` to calculate total tip amount earned by a particular delivery person.​
        - Sample input to `calculateTotalTipAmount()`:
            - Delivery Person: Andrew Clark
            - Expected result from `calculateTotalTipAmount`:
                15
    - function `getDeliveryWiseRatings()` to display delivery details for a particular delivery person.​
        - The details should include:​
            - orderNumber, customerName , customerRating, outletRating​
        - Sample input to `getDeliveryWiseRatings()`:
            - Delivery Person: Nicholas Taylor
        - Expected result from `getDeliveryWiseRatings()`:
            ```javascript
                { 
                    orderNumber :: 2224317
                    customerName :: Olivia Davis
                    customerRating :: 5
                    outletRating :: 4
                }
            ```
    - function `calculateAverageRating()` to calculate average rating of each delivery and store it in the JSON format.​
        - averageRating field value should be calculated using customerRating and outletRating.​
        - averageRating field should be added to the existing JSON data for each delivery.​
        - Validate and reformat the JSON data on https://jsonlint.com/.​
        - Copy and paste the JSON data in `deliveryData.json` file provided with the boilerplate.​
